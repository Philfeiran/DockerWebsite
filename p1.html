            <p class="text-muted textp">Virtualization is technology that lets you create useful IT services using resources that are traditionally bound to hardware. It allows you to use a physical machine’s full capacity by distributing its capabilities among many users or environments.

                    In more practical terms, imagine you have 3 physical servers with individual dedicated purposes. 
                    One is a mail server, another is a web server, and the last one runs internal legacy applications.
                     Each server is being used at about 30% capacity—just a fraction of their running potential. But since
                      the legacy apps remain important to your internal operations, you have to keep them and the third server that hosts them, right?
            </p>

                Traditionally, yes. It was often easier and more reliable to run individual tasks on individual servers: 1 server,
                 1 operating system, 1 task. It wasn’t easy to give 1 server multiple brains. But with virtualization, you can split
                  the mail server into 2 unique ones that can handle independent tasks so the legacy apps can be migrated. It’s the 
                  same hardware, you’re just using more of it more efficiently.</p>

             <p class="text-muted textp">
                 There are many reasons why people utilize virtualization in computing. To desktop users, the most common use is to
                  be able to run applications meant for a different operating system without having to switch computers or reboot into
                   a different system. For administrators of servers, virtualization also offers the ability to run different operating
                    systems, but perhaps, more importantly, it offers a way to segment a large system into many smaller parts, allowing the
                     server to be used more efficiently by a number of different users or applications with different needs. It also allows
                      for isolation, keeping programs running inside of a virtual machine safe from the processes taking place in another virtual 
                      machine on the same host.</p>
